 # Array 
 
 Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. 
 
 
 
 # Loops 
  its a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.
  Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

Types of loops that we can find in Java:
    1- Simple for loop
    2- Enhanced for-each loop
    3- While loop
    4- Do-While loop
    
## Foor Loop :

  The for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
  

## While loop :
  A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.

## Do While Loop 
  its the the for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
