## What is Terminal 
its a command line is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### Comands:
- pwd (Print Working Directory)
- cd [location] :_change directory_
- ls List the contents of a directory.



### Paths
- (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
- (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
- (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
- (mkdir) [options] <Directory> This to create a new folder
- (rmdir) This command to remove the folder if this folder is empty.
- (touch) [options] <filename> this command to create a new file.
- (cp )[options] <source> <destination> this for copy file  
- mv [options] <source> <destination>  move file 
- rm [options] <file> Removing a File (and non empty Directories).

### Linux is an Extensionless System
we should ude the extentions in terminal, and Linux is case sensitive.


The** manual pages** are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.
Some of them are a little hard to get your head around but they are fairly consistent in their structure so once you get the hang of it it's not too bad
