#### Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice
I was learnt in this article about  deliberate practice.
Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better.

The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
Repeated often
Feedback on results in continuously available
It's highly demanding mentally
It's difficult
It requires good goals
 
I shold picked the goals,It doesn't matter a great deal what the end result is, only what I learned on the way.

#  Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset
Using **Not Yet** it push the students to pass any exam, if any student failed in the exam its Not Yet it help them to think that: you can study hurd and pass.
Not yet like you can do better than you did.



#  Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
The key of success is simply Grit that's what she said after the search about how the student can pass and do will.
How much passion you have to make your goals and dreams be true, how much you put effort on it and give it time is the key of your success.
                     
       You shoud have a goals and deams, to push your self to be success.

# Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.
we shold be sure about our goals and dreams, what we want.
Why would us want to win in a war that is not ours and won't give a benifit for us anyway?
