#Binary search
##___________________________________________________

The algorithm compares the key value with the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the key cannot be part of is eliminated, and the search continues for the remaining half until it succeeds.

####Java provides three ways to perform a binary search:
- Using the iterative approach
- Using a recursive approach
- Using Arrays.binarySearch () method.
