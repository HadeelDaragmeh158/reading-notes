# Object-Oriented Programming


##### Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

# Classes
_Everything in Java is associated with classes_

Class declarations can include these components, in order:
- Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later. (However, note that the private modifier can only be applied to Nested Classes.)
- The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
- The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
- A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
- The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.

# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

#### Decimals
  Each digit in a decimal number has a Position,Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller.
  
#### Binary  
  "Base 2"
  
#### Hexadecimal Numbers  
  They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
